spawn up two sites/repos

one for the app
one for the landing page


use this ui lib: https://www.bits-ui.com/docs/getting-started

tailwind, leave testing for the app (vitest+playwright), drizzle for the app. All the other ones it recommends you.

Sveltekit on both, use a lot of SSR on landing (SEO!)
