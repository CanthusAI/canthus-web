- Use `bun` for everything, do not use npm or alternatives.
- When installing something, ensure you are in the correct directory.
- Never commit secrets. If env var is new, update .env.example and docs/README.md.
- Always include tests for bug fixes and new features, in the backend(server), or shared.
