A full-stack TypeScript monorepo starter with shared types, using Bun, Hono, Vite, and React.

## Why bhvr?

While there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much of a vendor lock-in. bhvr is built with the opinion that you should be able to deploy your client or server in any environment while also keeping type safety.

## Features

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo build orchestration and caching

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client/               # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ server/               # Hono backend
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
â””â”€â”€ turbo.json            # Turbo configuration for build orchestration
```

### Server

bhvr uses Hono as a backend API for its simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. 

### Client

This uses Vite + React Typescript, with tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui Tanstack Router and Tanstack Query.

### Shared

The Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both environments.

```
shared
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ types
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Inside the `src/index.ts` we export any of our code from the folders so it's usable in other parts of the monorepo

```typescript
export * from "./types"
```

By running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared'
```

## Usage

### Development

```bash
# Run all workspaces in development mode with Turbo
bun run dev

# Or run individual workspaces directly
bun run dev:client    # Run the Vite dev server for React
bun run dev:server    # Run the Hono backend
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all workspaces with Turbo
bun run build

# Or build individual workspaces directly
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
bun run build:server  # Build the Hono backend
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Lint all workspaces
bun run lint

# Type check all workspaces
bun run type-check

# Run tests across all workspaces
bun run test
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared/types';
```
